a)
You were asked to found a count, so the correct SELECT will be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PersonType)

b) -0.5
You lost a condition for date.
Correct answer:
SELECT  TOP 3   *
FROM Sales.SpecialOffer
WHERE StartDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2014-01-01'
ORDER BY DiscountPct DESC

e) -0.5
Color is not needed in the SELECT. After adding it to select, you had to add it to GROUP BY and it gave you incorrect result.
Correct answer:
SELECT  ProductSubcategoryID,
		MIN(Weight) AS Min_weight, 
		MAX(Size) AS Max_size
FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ProductSubcategoryID
